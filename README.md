# Restaurant Reviews App

### Udacity Front End Web Developing Project

## Project description

A static webpage is to be converted to a mobile ready web application by adding accessibility features and by making it responsive on different screen sizes. A service worker is also added to make the application available offline to users.

## Running the application

1. Clone this repository into your local code editor by typing the following command in your terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/gowriprathap/RestaurantReviewsApp_Udacity.git. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have by typing in `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install it.
    * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
